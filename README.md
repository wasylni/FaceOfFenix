Garmin Connect IQ watchface for Garmin Fenix series
===============


Notes:
------

This face is inspired by "My Watch" watch face by Benjamin Serant. I thik My Watch is the best watch face in existence, and i can't imagine using my Garmin watch wthout it. Unfortunately Benjamin stopped updating his project - some features (infamous "Sun data - need GPS usage" bug) are not working anymore, and there is no support for 6/6x series. So i decided to write my own watch face which would closely resemble "My Watch", and possibly make it open source.
